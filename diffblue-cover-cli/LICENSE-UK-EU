The Recipient shall not disclose Confidential Information to any third party without the Discloser's prior written consent save for those professional advisors, Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, suppliers and contractors who have entered into a written agreement with the Recipient that is no less protective of the Discloser's Confidential Information than this Agreement and who have a need to know such information. The Recipient shall assume liability for use of the Confidential Information by such persons. The Recipient shall use the same measures to protect the Discloser's Confidential Information that it uses to protect its own confidential information, but in no event less than reasonable measures.
